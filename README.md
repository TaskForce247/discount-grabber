# heisse-preise-template

This is a template project for anyone wanting to create a grocery price tracking app for their country, based on data found in the online stores of that country's grocery store chains.

The project was initially created to [track prices in Austria](https://heisse-preise.io). This fork is a bare bones version of that Austria specific project, with one example store integration.
